This is the README file for my personal portfolio website. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.

I first created a simple HTML/CSS website to showcase my projects and skills. I then decided to learn React and create a more dynamic website. I am currently working on adding more projects and features to the website. Finally, I used a full stack framework, nextjs, to create a blog site and deployed it through vercel
